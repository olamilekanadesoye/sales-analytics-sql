## Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL analytics capabilities on a sales data warehouse, covering:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding data structure, quality, and distributions
- **Advanced Analytics** - Time series analysis, cohort analysis, and performance benchmarking
- **Customer Report** - Segmentation, lifetime value, and behavioral analysis
- **Product Report** - Performance metrics, category analysis, and ranking

**Business Goal:** Extract actionable insights from sales data to drive strategic decision-making in areas of customer retention, product optimization, and revenue growth.

## Key Analyses

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Objective:** Understand data structure, quality, and initial patterns

**Key Questions Answered:**
- What is the date range of our sales data?
- What are the key business metrics (revenue, orders, customers)?
- How are customers distributed across countries and demographics?
- Which products and categories drive the most revenue?

**Techniques Used:**
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY for dimensional analysis
- Date functions (DATE_TRUNC, EXTRACT, AGE)
- JOINS to combine multiple tables for multi-table analyses
- UNION ALL to combine multiple queries for the consolidate metric report

### 2. **Advanced Analytics**

#### **Change Over Time Analysis**
- Month-over-month sales growth rate
- Customer acquisition trends
- 3-month rolling averages for trend smoothing

#### **Cumulative Analysis**
- Running total revenue by customer (Lifetime Value)
- Cumulative product sales with milestone tracking
- monthly revenue with running total

#### **Performance Analysis**
- Country performance benchmarking vs. average
- Year-over-year product comparison

#### **Part-to-Whole Analysis**
- Revenue contribution by category (Pareto Analysis)
- Gender-based purchase distribution
- category contribution to overall sales

#### **Data Segmentation**
- Customer Age Analysis
- Product cost range segmentation
- Customer segmentation by spending behavior

**Techniques Used:**
- Window functions (LAG, LEAD, ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Running totals and moving averages
- Complex aggregations and subqueries

### 3. **Business Reports**

#### **Customer Analytics Report**
- Base query: retrieve core columns from tables
- Customer aggregation: summarizes key metrics at the customer level
- Result transformation: calculate KPIs and apply business rule

[View Customer Report](03-customer-report/)

#### **Product Performance Report**
- Base query: retrieve core columns from tables
- Product aggregation: summarizes key metrics at the product level
- Result transformation: calculate KPIs and apply business rule

[View Product Report](04-product-report/)
